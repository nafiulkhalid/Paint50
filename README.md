**Harvardâ€™s CS50x 2024 Final Project**


A web-based painting application inspired by my childhood memories around MS Paint. In the world of Canva, Adobe, and more I chose this concept as my final project because I plan to implement every technology I learned in Harvard's CS50x that is: Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Flask, & Bootstrap.


**Tools:**


  1. Basic drawing tool - Brush

  2. Eraser

  3. Color palette (color selection)

  4. Clear (new canvas)


**Execution Plan:**


--> Frontend:


HTML for layout
CSS for styling
Bootstrap for fine lining
Javascript for interaction and canvas manipulation

--> Backend:

Python & flask for server-side logic

-- Research: 
How MS Paint works & what features do they have. Shortlisted features and googled their internal functioning.

--New skill: 
Explored Bootstrap more. Learned a few new topics on Javascript for the canvas interaction.


**Outcome with time-flexibility:**


I chose this project because from MS Paint to Adobe, I can stamp any limit on my time to build mine. For my project I would include AI-based features like auto-coloring or drawing suggestions. I may think about extending this feature during Harvard's CS50ai final week.
