# Paint50
A web-based painting application inspired by my childhood memories around MS Paint. In the world of Canva, Adobe, and more I chose this concept as my final project because I plan to implement every technology I learned in Harvard's CS50x that is: Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Flask, &amp; Bootstrap.
